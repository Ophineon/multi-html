        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>There's more to being a man than just being muscular, having hair and playing sports.
            <br>
            I am on that journey, to find my own understanding of what it means to be a man.
            <br>
            I pursue forms of power, combat my insecurities, hone my skills and try to assist others when possible.
            <br>
            I can't be satisfied until I surpass my current self. That new me, that better version of me, I will be a stepping stone towards their creation
        </p>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>Engineering is both a craft that requires practice in order to master and
            <br>
            an art form, a way of breathing life and giving form to something that was previously a mere concept.
            <br>
            I am familiar with python but to say that I am rusty is an understatement.
            <br>
            As an engineer, I have atrophied and stagnated however,
            <br>
            it would be foolish of me to deny myself or anyone, the capacity for reflection and improvement.
